This project generates pair(password login)
from pair(master-password name_of_site).
You cannot get master-password from other 3 components.
There is no base, so if you loss all data on your computer,
then you can install this program and you would get all back
your information about passwords and logins.
This program does not remember names of sites, where you have accounts.

If you use this program there are only three things that you 
should remember - your master-password, name of this program 
and sites where you have accounts.
