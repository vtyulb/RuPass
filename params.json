{"name":"Rupass","tagline":"Generator of passwords: enter name of site - get password","body":"### About\r\nThis project generates pair(password login)\r\nfrom pair(master-password name_of_site).\r\nYou cannot get master-password from other 3 components.\r\nThere is no base, so if you loss all data on your computer,\r\nthen you can install this program and you would get all back\r\nyour information about passwords and logins.\r\nThis program does not remember names of sites, where you have accounts.\r\n\r\nIf you use this program there are only three things that you \r\nshould remember - your master-password, name of this program \r\nand sites where you have accounts.\r\n\r\n### Algorithm\r\n\r\nAlgorithm of generation password and logins is simple:\r\nI take first two letters of password for gettin hash base.\r\nI take first half of password then site then second half of password.\r\n  \r\npassword: **socret_password**  \r\nsite: **name_of_site**  \r\nresult: **cret_pname_of_siteassword**  \r\n\r\nThen I take devil hash from this string. There is no way to understand\r\nwhat password was if you know hash and name of site.\r\nThis hash defines password and login.\r\nOne hash - one pair.\r\nHash is unsigned long long, so there are ~2^64 different pairs.\r\n\r\n### Content\r\n\r\nLogin already contains only 10 small latin letters.\r\nPassword already contains   \r\n---6 small latin letters  \r\n---1 big latin letter  \r\n---2 numbers  \r\n---1 special symbol !@#$%^&*|  \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<img src=\"http://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6e/cef/9bb/e6ecef9bbf52ed154d7ed0f6a7367825.png\"/>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
